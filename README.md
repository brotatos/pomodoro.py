What is Pomodoro?
-----------------
From Wikipedia:
```
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco
Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work
into intervals traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.
These intervals are known as "pomodori", the plural of the Italian word
pomodoro for "tomato".
